1. Your hash changes with each layout edit. You can share URLs & come back to them later.
2. You can click "preview HTML" to see what it would look like as a Bootstrap 4 webpage.
3. Triple click or press CMD + SHIFT + E (CTRL + SHIFT + E on Windows) to make the page editable (WYSIWYG). You aren't able to save.
4. Right-click on the items you wish to edit, if no immediate action is available.
